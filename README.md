# Recipe site

Developed with PERN stack and deployed with Render.
Familiar Recipes is a full stack CRUD project to keep track of your favorite recipes with a search functionality. Users can register/login to add new / update / delete recipes and save to favorites.
The frontend was built using Javascript, HTML, CSS and React. State management was implemented with Redux for user information and session token handled with JWT. Dynamic navigation and Routing was implemented with React router. API routing was created with Express.js and backend database was built using Postgresql.
